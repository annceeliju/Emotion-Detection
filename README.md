Project: Real-Time Emotion Detection

As part of the ongoing hands-on AI training journey, a real-time Emotion Detection system was successfully developed using Python, OpenCV, and the DeepFace library.

This project focuses on analyzing facial expressions from a live webcam feed and identifying the dominant human emotion â€” such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, and more â€” in real time. It combines the power of deep learning and computer vision to interpret emotions with just a few lines of code.

 OpenCV was used for real-time video capture
 DeepFace handled emotion analysis using pre-trained deep learning models
 Emotion overlay was displayed dynamically on the video feed using OpenCV

ðŸ’¡ Key Learnings:

- Real-time facial expression recognition
- Integration of deep learning models for emotion classification
- Enhancing user interaction using AI-powered computer vision
- Practical insights into deploying lightweight AI models for live analysis

This project deepened the understanding of emotion-aware systems and marked another exciting step in exploring AI for real-world applications.
